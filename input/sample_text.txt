The Glasgow summit presents the climate crisis as a global crisis, masking the fact that rich developed countries are the main culprits and poor countries get much of the burden.
The main problem: citizens of these countries have to change their consumption and lifestyle to help reduce the greenhouse gas emission.
 World leaders are worried that their citizens are not willing to pay the cost and change their way of life.
 There are exceptions, like the small group of people that travelled to Glasgow by bike and boat.
 But they are too few and, critics say, the bike and boat journey is actually not that much cleaner than flying.
 Ultimately, the people living in developed countries will have to make significant changes to their lifestyle, which includes, but is not limited to, transport.
 Meat consumption and fast fashion, to name but a few, are major contributors of emissions and limiting them requires a change in way of living.
 At the same time, several poor countries are entering economic and industrial growth and are expected to contribute increasingly to global emissions in the coming years.
 Proposals on how richer countries that caused the crisis are going to support the poor who suffer from it remain insufficient.
 Even the COP21 attendance reflects this with world leaders of large emitters declining and poorer developing countries not being able to afford sending large delegations to plead their case.
